  - context: |
        Red Hat Enterprise Linux AI allows you to do the following:
        Host an LLM and interact with the open source Granite family of Large Language Models (LLMs).
        Using the LAB method, create and add your own knowledge data in a Git repository and fine-tune a model with that data with minimal machine learning background.
        Interact with the model that has been fine-tuned with your data.
