      **RHEL AI** Red Hat Enterprise Linux AI is a foundation model platform to seamlessly develop, test, and run Granite family large language models (LLMs) for enterprise applications.
      RHEL AI is an open-source product that includes:
      Granite: an open source, Apache 2 licensed foundation model from IBM.
      InstructLab: a CLI and tuning backend that provides a simple user interface for contributing knowledge and skills to a base model.
      RHEL Image Mode (bootc): RHEL AI is distributed as a “bootable container” image. Provision RHEL AI appliances via kickstart onto bare metal or cloud instances.
      vLLM: A high-throughput and memory-efficient inference and serving engine for LLMs, based on PyTorch.
      deepspeed: A deep learning optimization software suite for both training and inference.
      PyTorch: PyTorch is an optimized tensor library for deep learning using GPUs and CPUs.
